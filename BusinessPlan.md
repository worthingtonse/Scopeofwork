# Software Pricing Models for RAIDAX

A well-defined pricing strategy is the cornerstone of software as a service (SaaS) success. It boosts conversions, improves monthly recurring revenue (MRR), and contributes to profitability through effective software pricing strategies. A solid software pricing strategy is essential for maximizing these benefits.

The SaaS landscape offers a variety of saas pricing models, each tailored to different customer needs and business goals. These models include:

* Subscription-based
* Usage-based
* Tiered pricing

## Freemium Pricing Model
No matter what our pricing model is, we will include a freemium model. The freemium pricing model offers free access to basic features, encouraging users to upgrade to premium versions for more advanced functionalities. This model reduces entry barriers, enabling RaidaTech to attract a broader audience with limited offerings. Companies like Dropbox have successfully used this model, achieving substantial user growth with over 700 million registered users.

Freemium pricing aims to hook users with free access, encouraging them to upgrade to a paid version after experiencing the product. Converting freemium customers to paid versions is often easier because they have experienced the product’s value. However, balancing free and paid users can be challenging, as many free users may never convert to paying customers.

Offering enough functionality to engage users without giving away too much is critical for freemium model success. Providing an exceptional free version may result in users not feeling the need to upgrade to a paid version. Companies need to carefully design their freemium offerings to ensure a seamless transition from free to paid plans.


## Subscription-Based Pricing Model
The subscription-based pricing model is a staple in the SaaS industry, where customers pay a regular fee, either monthly or annually, for access to the software. This model enhances customer retention and creates predictable revenue streams, making it a favorite among SaaS companies. Companies like Spotify and Netflix have demonstrated the wide applicability and effectiveness of this model, boasting high profitability and customer loyalty.

One of the advantages of the subscription model is its flexibility. As companies evolve, they can easily adapt their offerings to meet new market demands. However, it’s not without challenges. Early-stage SaaS businesses may face uncertainty in revenue and increased cancellation rates. Despite these challenges, many companies report median gross margins of around 80% on subscription revenue, highlighting its profitability.

The subscription model also allows various pricing structures, such as flat rate pricing, tiered pricing, or value-based pricing, to cater to different customer segments. This flexibility in SaaS pricing strategies enables companies to attract a broader customer base and adjust their pricing to stay competitive.


### Subscriptions based on the number of token serial numbers 
In this example, organizations would pay RaidaTech pay based on the maximum number of tokens that they are allowed to create. 

Version | Monthly Price |  Maximum Tokens | Notes
---|---|---|---
Free | $0 | 1000 | Customers can download the free version from our websites and customize it to their specifications
Small Org | $195 | 10,000 | Free version can be upgraded to Small Org
Enterprise | $455 | 100,000 | May include additional features yet to be developed
National | $600,000 | Unlimmited | Must be purchased from sales department

### Subscriptions based on the number of user accounts 
In this example, organizations pay based on the number of user accounts that they want to have access to authenticating tokens.

Version | Monthly Price |  Maximum Users | Notes
---|---|---|---
Free | $0 | 100 | Users can download the free version  and have up to 100 users before needing to upgrade. 
Small Org | $195 | 1,000 | Free version can be upgraded to Small Org
Enterprise | $455 | 10,000 | May include additional features yet to be developed
National | $600,000 | Unlimmited | Must be purchased from sales department


## Usage-Based Pricing Model

Usage-based pricing, also known as pay-as-you-go, is a flexible model where charges depend on the actual usage of the software, such as the number of transactions or API calls. This model aligns costs directly with consumption, much like utility bills, enhancing customer satisfaction. Companies like AWS exemplify this model, charging based on computing, storage, and outbound data transfer.

The usage-based model allows companies to benefit from rapid revenue spikes when customer usage increases unexpectedly. As usage increases, the cost rises; conversely, it decreases with lower usage, ensuring affordability even during price increases. However, this model can lead to unpredictable revenue and customer churn if not managed properly. Transparency in billing is crucial to mitigate these risks.

Implementing usage-based pricing involves complex revenue prediction and ensuring customers understand the billing structure. Despite these challenges, it remains a popular choice for software services that require consistent user engagement to deliver value. Common usage-based pricing models include pay-as-you-go, per-unit pricing, and usage-tier pricing.


### Usage based on Tokens that are priced based on packages
The customer would purchase serial numbers. The more the user buys, the less they pay per token. 

Resource used | Fee Per use | Time Period | Notes
---|---|---|---
Authentications | $0.01 | Each Time |  Everytime a batch of coins are authenticated, there is a fee associaated with it. 
Coin Swapping | 3% | Each Time | When people swap Bitcoin for their token, RaidaTech gets a percentage of the exchange
Locker Storage | $.01 | Each Time | People must pay to rent a locker (safe deposit box) on the RAIDA. 
CloudBank & SMS Bank | $10 | Monthly | This allows people to store their coins in the CloudBank which allows them to synch the coins on all devices and quickly send them to other users based on the user's phone number or email. 
Crypto Key sub custodial services | .001% or wallet balance | Monthly | We can store cryptographical keys for exchanges and banks to protect them from being hacked.
KYC (High Security)| $10 per user | Here we would allows customers to send KYC documents to the raida and we would then contract out with a company to provide KYC services
System Monitoring | $500 | Monthy | We can provide anti-money laundering, marketing and performane monitoring


### Usage based on Tokens that are all priced the same
It may make sense for us to charge a different flat fee for each different denomination. 
This amount could be 1% of the face value of the denomination.

Example Denomination | Price Per Denomination | Cost Per Token | Notes
---|---|---|---
.01 | $0.001 Each | $.01 | Cost per token does not change per denomination.
100| $1 Each | $.01  | When a customer purchases a 100 token note, they pay $1
10,000 | $100 | $.01  | When a customer purchases a ten thousand token note, they pay $100
100,000 | $1,000 | $.01  | When a customer purchases a one hundred thousand token note, they pay $1,000


## Tiered Pricing Model
The tiered pricing model offers multiple packages with different features and prices to cater to various user groups. This approach allows companies to maximize customer lifetime value by catering to different customer needs and budgets. Most prevalent in the SaaS industry, tiered pricing caters to a range of customer personas with diverse needs and budgets.

Typically, companies create three to five distinct pricing tiers, each offering specific benefits like features and support levels. A three-tier pricing structure effectively targets different customer segments simultaneously, making it easier for customers to compare options and select the package that best meets their needs. This model can improve conversion rates by providing a broader range of options and attracting diverse customers with varying budget levels.

Aligning the tiers with customer usage patterns and preferences is crucial for the success of this model. Feature-based pricing tiers enable customers to choose packages based on specific features they require, avoiding unnecessary costs. User count tiers are particularly beneficial for software services designed to support multiple users.

Here is a possible tiered pricing that RaidaTech Inc can commercialize its patented RAIDA technology. 

Tier | Price | What it does
---|---|---
Full Privacy | $10,000 | Does not require accounts and does not track users
Managed | $20,000 | Handles,
