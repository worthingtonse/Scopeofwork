## Token Purchases
Users get the software and 1,000 tokens for free but must pay for additional tokens. 

### Purchase of Token Packs
The more the user buys, the less they pay per token. 

Package Amount | Price Per Token | Cost for Packagte | Notes
---|---|---|---
1,000 | $0.01 Each | $100 | Most expensive option
10,000 | $0.006 Each | $60 |
100,000 | $0.003 | $300 |
1,000,000 | $0.001 | $1,000 | Least expensive option


### Purchase of single tokens at a standard price
It may make sense for us to charge a different flat fee for each different denomination. 
This amount could be 1% of the face value of the denomination.

Example Denomination | Price Per Denomination | Cost Per Token | Notes
---|---|---|---
.01 | $0.001 Each | $.01 | Cost per token does not change per denomination.
100| $1 Each | $.01  |
10,000 | $100 | $.01  |
100,000 | $1,000 | $.01  |
