  API_CLI & API_REST --> RAIDA_Protocol
  RAIDA_Protocol --> RAIDA
```
Breakdown:
Desktop SDKs: Connect via their respective APIs.
Mobile SDKs: Directly connect using the RAIDA protocol, without APIs.
RAIDA Protocol: Acts as the bridge to connect both API and SDK layers to the "RAIDA Array of Servers".
Connections: Use arrows to represent the flow between these elements.
Further Suggestions:
You may consider color-coding each category (such as APIs, SDKs, Protocols) for better visual distinction.
Labels or additional notes can describe each element's role or technological detail (e.g., "Desktop SDKs" using specific programming languages).
This diagram sets a clear pathway illustrating how different components in your network architecture interact. Let me know if there are any additional details or adjustments you'd like to make!




The Scope of work shall we decided into three different categories:

Self-Hosted by Customer
â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”-
To do self hosted by customer:
Depends on: 
1. Coin Registry Blockchain 
2. Open hosting (allows for more than 25 RAIDA)
3. Exchanges may need some extra tech too.
